#General Overview

This repo has been forked from The Odin Project's (TOR) CSS exercises. Each exercise will be done in the order specified by TOR and this readme will be updated with observations for each exercise.

#--Foundations

--01. CSS methods

No observations or difficulties, pretty straightforward, VScode autocomplete saved most of the typing. I can see how all that autocomplete can make you lazy or unknowledgeable.
